## Introduction

This page describes the data structures used by Tyk rich plugins, and is used in the following plugin drivers:

*   Python (built-in)
*   Lua (built-in)
*   gRPC (external, compatible with any supported [gRPC language](https://grpc.io/docs/))


We keep our stable Protocol Buffer definitions in the following GitHub repository:
[https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk/tree/master/coprocess/proto](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk/tree/master/coprocess/proto).
This is intended for users to generate their own bindings using the appropriate gRPC tools for the language used.

### MiniRequestObject (coprocess_mini_request_object.proto)

The `Coprocess.MiniRequestObject` is the main request data structure used by rich plugins. It's used for middleware calls and contains important fields like headers, parameters, body and URL. A `MiniRequestObject` is part of a `Coprocess.Object`.

```{.copyWrapper}
message MiniRequestObject {
   map<string, string> headers = 1;

   map<string, string> set_headers = 2;

   repeated string delete_headers = 3;

   string body = 4;

   string url = 5;

   map<string, string> params = 6;

   map<string, string> add_params = 7;

   map<string, string> extended_params = 8;

   repeated string delete_params = 9;

   ReturnOverrides return_overrides = 10;

   string method = 11;

   string request_uri = 12;

   string scheme = 13;

   bytes raw_body = 14;
}
```

#### Field Descriptions

`headers`
A read-only field for reading headers injected by previous middleware. Modifying this field won't alter the request headers See `set_headers` and `delete_headers` for this.

`set_headers`
This field appends the given headers (keys and values) to the request.

`delete_headers`
This field contains an array of header names to be removed from the request.

`body`
Contains the request body. See `ReturnOverrides` for response body modifications.

`raw_body`
Contains the raw request body (bytes).

`url`
The request URL.

`params`
A read-only field that contains the request params. Modifying this value won't affect the request params.

`add_params`
Add paramaters to the request.

`delete_params`
This field contains an array of parameter keys to be removed from the request.

`return_overrides`
See `ReturnOverrides` for more information.

`method`
The request method, e.g. GET, POST, etc.

`request_uri`
Raw unprocessed URL which includes query string and fragments.

`scheme`
Contains the URL scheme, e.g. `http`, `https`.

### Object (coprocess_object.proto)

The `Coprocess.Object` data structure data structure wraps a `Coprocess.MiniRequestObject` It contains additional fields that are useful for users that implement their own request dispatchers, like the middleware hook type and name.
It also includes the session state object (`SessionState`), which holds information about the current key/user that's used for authentication.

```{.copyWrapper}
message Object {
 HookType hook_type = 1;

 string hook_name = 2;

 MiniRequestObject request = 3;

 SessionState session = 4;

 map<string, string> metadata = 5;

 map<string, string> spec = 6;
}
```

#### Field Descriptions

`hook_type`
Contains the middleware hook type: pre, post, custom auth.

`hook_name`
Contains the hook name.

`request`
Contains the request object, see `MiniRequestObject` for more details.

`session`
Contains the session object, see `SessionState` for more details.

`metadata`
Contains the metadata. This is a dynamic field.

`spec`
Contains information about API definition, including `APIID`, `OrgID` and `config_data`.

### ReturnOverrides (coprocess_return_overrides.proto)

The `ReturnOverrides` object, when returned as part of a `Coprocess.Object`, overrides the response of a given HTTP request. It also stops the request flow and the HTTP request isn't passed upstream. The fields specified in the `ReturnOverrides` object are used as the HTTP response.
A sample usage for `ReturnOverrides` is when a rich plugin needs to return a custom error to the user.

```{.copyWrapper}
syntax = "proto3";

package coprocess;

message ReturnOverrides {
  int32 response_code = 1;
  string response_error = 2;
  map<string, string> headers = 3;
  bool override_error = 4;
  string response_body = 5;
}
```

#### Field Descriptions

`response_code`
This field overrides the HTTP response code and can be used for error codes (403, 500, etc.) or for overriding the response.

`response_error`
This field overrides the HTTP response body.

`headers`
This field overrides response HTTP headers.

`override_error`
This field allows higher customisation when returning custom errors. Should be used in combination with `response_body`.

`response_body`
This field is the alias for `response_error`. Contains the HTTP response body.


### SessionState (session_state.proto)

A `SessionState` data structure is created for every authenticated request and stored in Redis. It's used to track the activity of a given key in different ways, mainly by the built-in Tyk middleware like the quota middleware or the rate limiter.
A rich plugin is able to create a `SessionState` object and store it in the same way built-in authentication mechanisms do. This is what a custom authentication middleware does. This is also part of a `Coprocess.Object`.
Returning a null session object from a custom authentication middleware is considered a failed authentication and the appropriate HTTP 403 error is returned by the gateway (this is the default behaviour) and can be overridden by using `ReturnOverrides`.

`last_check`
No longer used.

`allowance`
No longer used, should be the same as `rate`.

`rate` 
The number of requests that are allowed in the specified rate limiting window.

`per`
The number of seconds that the rate window should encompass.

`expires`
An epoch that defines when the key should expire.

`quota_max`
The maximum number of requests allowed during the quota period.

`quota_renews`
An epoch that defines when the quota renews.

`quota_remaining`
The number of requests remaining for this user's quota (unrelated to rate limit).

`quota_renewal_rate`
The time in seconds during which the quota is valid. So for 1000 requests per hour, this value would be 3600 while `quota_max` and `quota_remaining` would be 1000.

`access_rights`
Access rights can be defined either by the Dashboard or via an API, depending on the version of Tyk you are using. See our [Tutorials]({{< ref "getting-started/installation" >}}) section for  for more details.

`org_id`
The organisation this user belongs to. This can be used in conjunction with the org_id setting in the API Definition object to have tokens "owned" by organisations.

`oauth_client_id`
This is set by Tyk if the token is generated by an OAuth client during an OAuth authorisation flow.

`basic_auth_data`
This section defines the basic auth password and hashing method.

`jwt_data`
This section contains a JWT shared secret if the ID matches a JWT ID.

`hmac_enabled`
If this token belongs to an HMAC user, this will set the token as a valid HMAC provider.

`hmac_secret`
The value of the HMAC shared secret.

`is_inactive`
Set this value to true to deny access.

`apply_policy_id`
The policy ID that is bound to this token.

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

Although `apply_policy_id` is still supported, it is now deprecated. `apply_policies` is now used to list your policy IDs as an array. This supports the **[Multiple Policy]({{< ref "basic-config-and-security/security/security-policies/partitioned-policies#a-name-multiple-a-multiple-policies" >}})** feature introduced in the  **v2.4 - 1.4** release.
{{< /note >}}


`data_expires`
A value, in seconds, that defines when data generated by this token expires in the analytics DB (must be using Pro edition and MongoDB).

`monitor`
Rate monitor trigger settings, defined elsewhere in the documentation.

`enable_detailed_recording`
Set this value to true to have Tyk store the inbound request and outbound response data in HTTP Wire format as part of the analytics data.

`metadata`
Meta data to be included as part of the session. This is a key/value string map that can be used in other middleware such as transforms and header injection to embed user-specific data into a request, or alternatively to query the providence of a key.

`tags`
Tags are embedded into analytics data when the request completes. If a policy has tags, those tags will supersede the ones carried by the token (they will be overwritten).

`alias`
As of v2.1, an Alias offers a way to identify a token in a more human-readable manner, add an Alias to a token in order to have the data transferred into Analytics later on so you can track both hashed and un-hashed tokens to a meaningful identifier that doesn't expose the security of the underlying token.

`id_extractor_deadline`
See [Auth Plugins]({{< ref "plugins/plugin-types/auth-plugins/auth-plugins" >}}) for additional information.

`session_lifetime`
Overrides the global session lifetime, see [Physical Token Expiry]({{< ref "basic-config-and-security/security/authentication-authorization/physical-key-expiry" >}}) for additional information.

### ResponseObject (coprocess_response_object.proto)

The `ResponseObject` is used by response hooks, the fields are populated with the upstream HTTP response data.
All the field contents can be modified.

```{.copyWrapper}
syntax = "proto3";

package coprocess;

message ResponseObject {
  int32 status_code = 1;
  bytes raw_body = 2;
  string body = 3;
  map<string, string> headers = 4;
  repeated Header multivalue_headers = 5;
}

message Header {
  string key = 1;
  repeated string values = 2;
}
```

#### Field Descriptions

`status_code`
This fields indicates the HTTP status code that was sent by the upstream.

`raw_body`
This field contains the HTTP response body (bytes). It's always populated.

`body`
This field contains the HTTP response body in string format. It's not populated if the `raw_body` contains invalid UTF-8 characters.

`headers`
A map that contains the headers sent by the upstream.

`multivalue_headers`
A list of headers, each header in this list is a structure that consists of two parts: a key and its corresponding values.
The key is a string that denotes the name of the header, the values are a list of strings that hold the content of the header, this is useful when the header has multiple associated values.
This field is available for Go, Python and Ruby since tyk v5.0.4 and  5.1.1+.
