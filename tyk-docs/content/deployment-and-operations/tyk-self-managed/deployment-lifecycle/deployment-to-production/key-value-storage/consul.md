[Consul](https://www.consul.io) from Hashicorp is a distributed, highly available, and data centre aware solution to connect and configure applications across dynamic, distributed infrastructure. It can be used to store and retrieve Tyk Gateway configuration across multiple data centers.

### How to configure Tyk to access Consul
Configuring Tyk Gateway to read values from Consul is straightforward - you simply configure the connection in your Tyk Gateway config file (`tyk.conf`) by adding the `kv` section as follows:

``` json
{
    "kv": {
        "consul": {
            "address": "localhost:8025",
            "scheme": "http",
            "datacenter": "dc-1",
            "timeout": 30,
            "http_auth": {
                "username": "",
                "password": ""
            },
            "wait_time": 10,
            "token": "",
            "tls_config": {
                "address": "",
                "ca_path": "",
                "ca_file": "",
                "cert_file": "",
                "key_file": "",
                "insecure_skip_verify": false
            }
        }
    }
}
```

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| address | The location of the Consul server |
| scheme |  The URI scheme for the Consul server, e.g. `http` |
| datacenter |  Consul datacenter (agent) identifier |
| timeout | |
| http_auth | Username and password for Tyk to log into Consul using HTTP Basic Auth (if required) |
| wait_time | |
| token | |
| tls_config | Configuration for TLS connection to Consul (if required) |

Alternatively, you can configure it using the [environment variables]({{< ref "tyk-oss-gateway/configuration#kvconsuladdress" >}}).

### How to access data stored in Consul
The notation used to refer to a key-value pair stored in Consul depends upon the location of the reference as follows.

#### Tyk Gateway configuration file
As described [here]({{< ref "tyk-configuration-reference/kv-store#tyk-gateway-configuration-file" >}}), from Tyk Gateway's configuration file (`tyk.conf`) you can retrieve values from Consul using the following notation:
 - `consul://path/to/key`

#### API definition
From Tyk Gateway v5.3 onwards, you can store **any `string` field** from the API definition in Consul; for earlier versions of Tyk Gateway only the **Target URL** and **Listen Path** fields were supported. 

As described [here]({{< ref "tyk-configuration-reference/kv-store#api-definitions" >}}), from an API definition you can retrieve values from Consul using the following notation:
 - `consul://path/to/key`

There is an exception to this rule for certain [transformation middleware]({{< ref "tyk-configuration-reference/kv-store#transformation-middleware" >}}) for which you can retrieve values using the following notation:
 - `$secret_consul.KEY`
